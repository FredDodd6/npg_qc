NPG_QC Installation Guide
=========================

If you are familiar with the NPG tracking application, then this should work
with the same stubs (however, there are less dependencies). There is a dependency
on NPG, and some others.

Environment
===========
NPG can be deployed within ModPerl::Registry under Apache but the simplest and most generic method for deploying NPG is as a CGI and this is what is covered here. You will need:

  1. Apache configured with a CGI directory
  2. A MySQL instance
  3. A Perl installation with the following additional modules (taken
     from Makefile.PL):

    Template
    ClearPress
    DBI
    Config::IniFiles
    MIME::Lite
    Fatal
    HTML::PullParser
    Memoize
    Date::Calc
    List::MoreUtils
    Class::Std

There are other local WTSI dependencies involved which we will replace
with cut-down versions. These are:

    SangerPaths
    SangerWeb

Dependencies
============

NPG_COMMON
==========

A set of modules common to all npg applications. These can be obtained from the
website where this was obtained.

NPG
===

The NPG tracking application is tied into this both through the data loading
modules, and the web application when it tries to find run_pairs. With a little
changing, you could easily remove these requirements (npg_qc::api::main and
npg_qc::model::id_run_pair).

The run pairs are cached in a table, so you can mock this out very easily by
prepopulating this table.

The data loading uses NPG to find runs which are at a particular stage of our
pipeline. If you are using NPG, this will work exactly, else it could be
bypassed by feeding in the runs you want to do manually.

Srpipe
======

The srpipe requirements are to find the full paths to files given some fuzzy
matching against run ids for the data loader. Should you be able to provide a
list of pathnames, this could be easily mocked out.

SangerPaths
===========

SangerPaths is a derivative of Module::PortablePath with localised
configuration. It is used to provide platform-independant perl library
paths. If you don't already use Module::PortablePath then it is
reasonable to comment-out SangerPaths in cgi-bin/npg and if necessary
replace with any 'use lib' lines you may require.


SangerWeb
=========

SangerWeb provides various core website services at the
WTSI. Principally the website branding and decoration but also the
single sign on system and user sessioning by HTTP Cookies. SangerWeb
loosely provides the same API as ClearPress::decorator, so look at
subclassing that and implementing hooks to tie in to your own sign-on,
sessioning and page decoration mechanisms.

It should be possible to use ClearPress::decorator as a basic, direct,
drop-in replacement for SangerWeb but it does not contain provision
for authentication and database access.

As this application stands, there is no need to authenticate using the
single sign on, as most of the user interaction is read only.

Website::Utilities::Profiler and LoggingDBI
===========================================

These are small tools for debugging and testing. They have been
included in the lib-ext/ folder of this distribution.

Database
========

A MySQL schema relating to this release is available in the data/
folder, together with the contents of some of the dictionary tables.


Apache Web Server
=================

Alias   /css/npg_qc.css /home/npg_qc/current/htdocs/css/npg_qc.css
Alias   /css/npg_qc.js /home/npg_qc/current/htdocs/css/npg_qc.js
<Directory      /home/npg_qc/current/cgi-bin>
        SetHandler              cgi-script
        Options                 ExecCGI
        AllowOverride           None
        Order                   deny,allow
        Allow                   from all
</Directory>
<Directory      /home/npg_qc/current/htdocs>
        Options                 ExecCGI
        AllowOverride           None
        Order                   deny,allow
        Allow                   from all
</Directory>


Platform
========

NPG is actively developed on both Debian Linux and Mac OSX 10.5
without any problems. There's no known reason why it shouldn't
run using ActivePerl or Cygwin on Windows.
