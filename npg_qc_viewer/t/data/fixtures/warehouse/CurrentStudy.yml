  abstract: 'The project aims to investigate evolutionarily-interesting regions of the human genome. These often show signals of positive natural selection. Resequencing the same region of DNA in multiple humans provides a complete catalogue of the variants it contains and their distribution in the sample, and is the best basis for characterising positive selection. We have chosen a number of regions of the genome that are either of known evolutionary interest, or that show a possible signal of selection that we want to investigate further, along with some controls, and are resequencing them in a population sample of 30. Our analyses will extract information on neutral and selective aspects of the evolutionary history of these regions.'

  description: 'The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Pathogen Genomics group is sequencing a number of malaria parasite strains/isolates. As part of this project, the human malaria parasite P. ovale is being sequenced to a high coverage using the Illumina sequencing technology platform. Recently, P. ovale has been described to exist as two separate non-recombining species that are sympatric in both Africa and Asia (Sutherland et al. JID, 2010). P. ovale parasites are therefore identified as ‘classic’ or ‘variant’ based upon genetic dimorphism. We aim to generate annotated reference genomes both the classical (Plasmodium ovale curtisi) and the variant type (Plasmodium ovale wallikeri) species..
